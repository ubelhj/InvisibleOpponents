# InvisibleOpponents
Make people invisible! Challenge a GC to beat an invisible plat to test their gamesense. Or challenge a plat to beat an invisible GC if you want to see a really high score.

Designed for LAN / Rocket Plugin use.   
1. Every player in the match needs the plugin loaded and enabled.   
2. The players that join the match can choose to enable "Make opponent invisible".  
3. Any players that spectate can toggle "Make blue invisible" or "Make orange invisible" to see the perspective of either team 

Uses the amazing [netcode plugin library](https://github.com/CinderBlocc/NetcodeManager) by CinderBlock.  
Uses a [netcode plugin template for Visual Studio 2019](https://github.com/ubelhj/BakkesmodNetcodePluginTemplate) made by myself, built on top of the [Bakkesmod Plugin template](https://github.com/Martinii89/BakkesmodPluginTemplate) by Martinii89.   
This isn't necessary to make a netcode plugin, but it sets some things up more easily. I made it to speed up plugin creation.
